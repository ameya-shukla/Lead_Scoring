# Lead_Scoring
Built a Logistic Regression model for an Ed-Tech firm to predict leads that are likely to enrol themselves in a course offered by the company on their website. The model also gives a lead score to each customer in terms of the probability of them turning into a lead, which could help the company find the likelihood of each customer becoming a lead.
